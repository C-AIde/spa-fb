# Vision

We enable non-technical people to design an app on their phone so that they can also deploy it for free.

# Mission

We provide an [open source](https://opensource.org) development tool for phones using [Domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), a [Unified Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language), [Command-Query Responsibility Segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Query_Responsibility_Segregation), and [Event Sourcing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing). We also provide easy deployment for simple applications. The tool can be used by all software engineers, regardless of programming language or technology, so that as many people as possible can build an application for their needs.

# Strategy

We focus on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)-based application development, where the technology choices for the design and target application are [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [React](https://react.dev), [MUI](https://mui.com), and [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/).

The design application is internationalized and support is initially in English and Finnish.
